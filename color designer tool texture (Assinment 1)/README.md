# ðŸŽ¨ Color Design Tool

A simple and interactive **color design tool** built with **HTML and CSS**.  
This tool displays multiple color boxes, each filled with a unique color.  
When you hover over a box:
- **Light colors** turn darker  
- **Dark colors** turn lighter  

This project was created as part of my **Banu Qabil Web Development Course** to practice **CSS styling, and hover effects**.
