# Lazarev.com Clone (Team Project)

This is my **first team-based project**, created during my learning journey.  
We attempted to **clone the Lazarev Agency website** using **HTML** and **CSS**, making it **fully responsive** with some animations at the start.

Our main goal was to **practice teamwork**, improve our **HTML/CSS skills**, and understand how a professional agency website can be recreated from scratch.
